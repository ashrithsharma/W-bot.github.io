Firstly, limiting the intake of caffeine and excessive sugar can help manage symptoms like breast tenderness and mood swings. Highly processed foods, known for their high salt and additive content, should be minimized to reduce bloating and water retention. Fried and fatty foods may exacerbate inflammation and increase cramping, so opting for lighter, healthier options is recommended. Some women find that dairy products worsen bloating and cramps, making alternatives like almond or soy milk worth considering. Alcohol consumption should be moderated, as it can disrupt sleep patterns and contribute to dehydration. While moderate exercise is beneficial, intense workouts may increase fatigue and discomfort. Choosing loose, comfortable clothing over tight attire can alleviate bloating and discomfort. Stress-reducing activities, such as deep breathing and meditation, can help manage emotional well-being. Additionally, maintaining regular meals is crucial to avoid low energy levels and mood swings. Lastly, practicing safe intercourse is advised, especially if pregnancy is not intended."},
